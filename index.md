### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 was a favorite because it was the first lab where I felt independent because we had to create our own contents for the programs. I specifically liked part 3 because we created the hilo game using if statements for the first time. This lab taught me patience because of the many trials and errors I had to go through to get the desired output based on the specific scenario. 

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 was a favorite because it was the first time we used strings in our code. My favorite part of the lab was part 3 because we created a blackjack game and I’ve played the game before in Vegas, and was curious how the game could be played through a program. This lab took me the longest to create because I didn’t know how to properly implement a string, but it taught me how to read input from the user. 

* Lab 6
    Lab 6 was a favorite because it was the first time we used loops in our code. In part 1, I really enjoyed being able to make a pattern from only a few lines of code. I liked part 2 of the code because the guessing game we created repeated until the player guessed the correct number, and then asked the user if they wanted to play again. This lab taught me how to simplify codes that contain parts that need to be reiterated multiple times.
